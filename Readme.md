# Banana-Ripeness-Classifier- IOS-Application

- Utilized Xception, a powerful deep learning algorithm, to accurately predict banana ripeness in Walmart stores, optimizing the supply chain and reducing waste.
- Improved customer satisfaction and enhanced brand reputation by ensuring high-quality bananas are sold in stores.
- Potential to save millions of dollars in lost revenue by reducing waste, aligning with strategic goals of cost reduction and efficiency improvement.
- Supports Walmart's sustainability strategy by reducing the environmental impact of food waste, contributing to strengthened sustainability practices.
- Used the valid, test set and real-time mobile application to evaluate the performance, with outstanding more than 80% accuracy

## Features

- Accurately categorizes banana ripeness into four stages: Underripe, Barely Ripe, Ripe, and Overripe.
- Displays estimated best before date for optimal quality assurance.
- Dynamic pricing feature allows staff to adjust selling price for overripe bananas to maximize sales volume.

If a validation accuracy of more than 80% is achieved using an Xception model, it can be aligned with state-of-the-art performance for that architecture. In the field of deep learning and computer vision, 80% accuracy is a high level of performance and suggests that the model can accurately recognize and classify objects in images.


## FAQ

#### Why would we suggest In-house development for the application ? 

We decided to develop the banana ripeness app in-house to customize it according to our needs, scale it to include other fruits, and leverage our in-house AI analytics team's expertise. This approach allows us to integrate the app more seamlessly with our existing systems and ultimately reduce the cost and effort required for manual checking, improve monitoring accuracy, and enhance our customers' experience.
#### Why would we use Xception as our deep learning model? 

Xception is the preferred deep learning model for image classification, based on its excellent performance on small datasets and complex image comparisons. Although it may require costly computational resources for larger datasets, its potential for transfer learning and application in other computer vision tasks makes it an attractive choice. While newer models may compete with Xception, it remains a relevant and viable option for image classification tasks.
